FIRSTLY UP!!!
Can I pull out a common set of steps, and have both windows & nix scripts run it? currently we'll be doing a lot of repetition.
Yeah, some things may be specific to one or t'other, but the bulk of things wants to be the same.


Manual steps performed:

01. Run linkify to set up vimrc & vsvimrc
02. mkdir dotfiles/vim/autoload
03. curl https://tpo.pe/pathogen.vim -outfile ./vim/autoload/pathogen.vim
